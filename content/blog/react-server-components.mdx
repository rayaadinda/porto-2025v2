## React Server Components: Building Faster, More Efficient Web Apps

React Server Components are revolutionizing how we think about rendering and data fetching in React applications. Let's explore how to leverage this powerful pattern for better performance and user experience.

### What Are Server Components?

Server Components run on the server and can directly access backend resources like databases, file systems, or APIs without exposing sensitive information to the client.

### Key Benefits

- **Zero Bundle Size**: Server Components don't ship to the client
- **Direct Backend Access**: No need for API routes for simple data fetching
- **Improved Performance**: Reduced JavaScript bundle and faster initial page loads
- **Better SEO**: Content is rendered on the server

### Practical Examples

```jsx
// ProductList.server.jsx
import { db } from './lib/database'

export default async function ProductList() {
  const products = await db.products.findMany()
  
  return (
    <div>
      {products.map(product => (
        <ProductCard key={product.id} product={product} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Best Practices

1. Use Server Components for data fetching
2. Keep Client Components minimal
3. Compose Server and Client Components effectively
4. Handle loading and error states properly

Server Components are the future of React development, offering unparalleled performance and developer experience.
